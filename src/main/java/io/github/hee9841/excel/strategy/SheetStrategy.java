/**
 * Strategy enum that determines how Excel sheets are created and managed during export operations.
 * <p>
 * This enum controls whether data is exported to a single sheet or multiple sheets, which affects
 * the Zip64 mode used when creating large Excel files. Each strategy is associated with a specific
 * {@link Zip64Mode} that optimizes file handling based on the expected data volume.
 * <p>
 * The Zip64 mode affects how Apache POI handles large Excel files:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code ONE_SHEET}: Uses {@code AsNeeded} mode, which only enables Zip64 extensions when required</li>
 *   <li>{@code MULTI_SHEET}: Uses {@code Always} mode, which always enables Zip64 extensions for better
 *       handling of multiple sheets</li>
 * </ul>
